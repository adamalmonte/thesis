# Landing page code challenge

Design tweak: It doesn't make sense to have the menu visible AND have the hamburger menu on desktop, so I
1) Limited the hamburger menu to only appear on mobile and tablet viewport widths
2) Right-aligned the menu links instead of centering them on desktop

In the interest of time, all the CSS and JS is included within index.html as style/ script tags.
